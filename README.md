# simon-game-js
A javascript implementation of the real game Simon. This code is based off the following tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_ec3eowFLQ&index=3&list=PLWKjhJtqVAbleDe3_ZA8h3AO2rXar-q2V&t=0s

I did modify the code and styling heavily so the end result is different than in the tutorial although the core game functions are the same. I plan to eventually create a settings panel that can toggle noise, game difficulty, as well as setting a  turn limit for the game (set to 20 by default);
