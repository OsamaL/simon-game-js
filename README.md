# simon-game-js
A javascript implementation of the real game Simon. This code is based off the following tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_ec3eowFLQ&index=3&list=PLWKjhJtqVAbleDe3_ZA8h3AO2rXar-q2V&t=0s

I did modify the code and styling heavily so the end result is different than in the tutorial.
